        <h2>Sports I Played in High School</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basketball</strong> – I played point guard for all four years, captaining my team in my senior year. Never loved it until highschool, but ended up being my favorite. </li>
            <li><strong>Track & Field</strong> – I specialized in sprints, breaking a few school records with my relay team. We were the only ones on our team to make it to states.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer</strong> – Played as a forward, captain for two years. We were never great in highschool, but this was the sport I had played since I was 3. Started my love for sports. Played on an all boys team</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why I Love Sports</h2>
        <p><em>Sports have always been my passion.</em> Both of my parents grew up being big sports fan and they both did a sport in college so they wanted me and my sisters to love sports just as much as they did. When we were younger I got to go to lots of Red’s games and watched the Bengals every sunday. After school I practiced with my sports teams and on the weekends I had games. Gym class was always my favorite subject (if you even consider it a subject). It helped that I wasn’t horrible at sports, so they were fun for me. I was always the closest of friends with my teammates, basically my whole life revolved around sports since I played so many. The spring of my 7th and 8th grade year I did three sports: Track, Softball and Club Soccer. This is when I knew I could never give up sports, because if I did that without hating any of the sports at the end, then I could work with sports forever.</p>

        <h2>Why I Chose Sports Communication and Media</h2>
        <p><strong>Sports media</strong> became my calling after realizing how much I enjoyed running my sport team’s Instagram accounts. It sounds stupid, but I cared so much about how they looked and how many people liked them. I also knew I wanted to be on this side of the sports industry because I was huge about wanting people to know about my sport teams, our successes, when our games were, etc. I wanted people to come to our games and cheer us on. That is exactly what sports media is for. To get people to get excited or more interested about the team through social media, broadcasting, marketing, news, journals, etc. I am a very creative person. I spent most of my time in highschool in the art room, with either graphic design or photography/photoshop classes. I knew I wanted to incorporate that into my career. So sports communication and media it is. </p>

        <h3>Reflection on My Journey</h3>
        <p><strong>From playing on the field to working behind the camera or phone,</strong> I've seen the power of sports not only as a form of entertainment but also as a tool for social change. My experiences have shaped my ambition to contribute to the world of sports media and communication, where I hope to inspire others the way I was inspired. I hope to create content that makes people wantt to see these teams. I want teams to feel like they have so much support and people that want to watch them because as a woman who played sports I never got that and it was the worst feeling.</p>
