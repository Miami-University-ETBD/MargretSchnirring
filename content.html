        <h3>Why I Love These Sports</h3>
        <p><strong>Each sport I work with holds a unique place in my heart.</strong> I donâ€™t work with as much, but football is such a cool sport to work. I never had a football team at my highschool so I never had any experience that environment. Basketball will forver have a special place in my heart because I played it. I know the level of the game like the players do and know why they do things they do and act the way they do.</p>
